        <h2> "<strong>The Dish</strong>", a Cynthia and Jackson Classic Adventure </h2>
        <p> A meal somewhat improvised from Binging wish Babish. 
            "<strong>The dish</strong>" got its name because when Cynthia wanted me to remake it, she simply asked "can you make <strong>the dish</strong> again" 
            and it just stuck. When she would meal prep she'd say "I'm thinking about making <strong>the dish</strong>".
             Although "<strong>the dish</strong>"" is a simple and quick meal of pasta with with pesto and veggie,
              time has shown that there is a specific sequence that yields the best results. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients </h2>
        <ul>
            <li> 1 Zucchini </li>
            <li> 1 Summer Squashs</li>
            <li> ~10 oz of Cherry Tomatoes</li>
            <li> 1/2 box pasta of your choice, I like the swirly twist ones</li>

            <li>Add salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes to vegetables and let cook until soft ~10 minutes. 
                (Move occasionaly to make sure nothing burns, but not so often that vegetables don't cook)</li>
            <li>Once vegetables are fork soft, add pasta and saved pasta water. 
                Mix thoroughly and let simmer over medium-low heat until excess liquid has evaporated.</li>
